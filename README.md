 Hi there 👋 I am Kalyani and 
 I make jokes when i am uncomfortable🤔

 
 🎯 Curiosity fuels my quest for knowledge, and I am constantly exploring new technologies and trends in the dynamic realm of computer engineering 🌐.
 
 🔭When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring my creative side through photography 📸 embracing myself in the fascinating world of literature 📚.
 
 ⚡As an advocate of continuous improvement, I believe that learning extends beyond the classroom, and I am committed to contributing to open-source projects to 
    enhance the technology landscape 🌱.
